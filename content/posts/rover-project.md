In this software project we use image processing techniques on a single area of a live video feed to identify the number of fingers on display. The main image processing technique used is identifying contours. A contour is created by joining all the continuous points of an image that have the same color. Contours can be used for various image processing programs like shape analysis, object detection or recognition.

Image contouring is an important tool with uses in any field. It is used in medical research to identify important information, such as organs or tumors in MRI images, CT scans, or cardiac images. Object detection includes identifying persons. This could be implemented in public spaces during this pandemic to count the number of people in a shop.![Image alt](../images/rover.jpg)
Object detection and tracking is currently used in military technology. Unmanned aircrafts prove to be a threat to military bases. Military security uses this form of image processing to detect unmanned aircrafts and track their location. Cameras placed around the perimeter of a base that can apply image processing will be able to give ample warning of what the program considers a threat.
